# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Retention-Model

**Customer Churn Prediction Model**

**Project Goal:**
To **predict customer churn** â€“ identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a service or product. This proactive insight empowers businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and enhance customer lifetime value.

**Importance of Solving This Problem (In Detail):**
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses across all industries. High churn rates can significantly impact revenue, growth, and profitability. Solving the problem of churn prediction is not merely an analytical exercise; it offers substantial strategic and financial benefits:

**Revenue Protection and Growth:**

* **Direct Revenue Loss Prevention:** When a customer churns, the business loses all future revenue that customer would have generated. Predicting churn allows interventions to save that recurring income.
* **Increased Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Retaining customers for longer periods directly increases their CLV. A small improvement in retention can lead to a substantial increase in overall CLV across the customer base.
* **Cross-Selling and Up-Selling Opportunities:** Loyal, retained customers are often more receptive to purchasing additional products or services, further boosting revenue.

**Cost Efficiency:**

* **Reduced Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC):** Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. By preventing churn, businesses reduce the constant need to spend heavily on new customer acquisition.
* **Optimized Marketing Spend:** Instead of broad, untargeted retention campaigns, churn prediction allows for focused marketing efforts towards high-risk, high-value customers, making marketing spend more efficient.

**Enhanced Customer Experience and Satisfaction:**

* **Proactive Problem Solving:** By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can reach out to address their pain points, offer solutions, or provide personalized incentives before they decide to leave. This transforms a potentially negative experience into a positive one.
* **Personalization:** Understanding the specific reasons for churn (through feature importance analysis) enables businesses to tailor services, products, or offers to individual customer needs, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.

**Strategic Decision Making:**

* **Product and Service Improvement:** Analysis of churn drivers (e.g., specific features, contract types, customer support issues) provides invaluable feedback for improving products, services, and operational processes.
* **Resource Allocation:** Insights from churn prediction can guide resource allocation across different departments (e.g., customer service, product development, sales) to address root causes of dissatisfaction.
* **Competitive Advantage:** Businesses that effectively manage churn gain a competitive edge by maintaining a stable customer base and adapting more quickly to market demands.

**Predictive Power and Foresight:**

* **Early Warning System:** The model acts as an early warning system, flagging potential churners, allowing for timely intervention rather than reacting after the fact.
* **Scenario Planning:** Businesses can simulate the impact of different strategies (e.g., price changes, new features) on churn rates to inform future planning.

In essence, churn prediction transforms a reactive business approach into a **proactive, data-driven strategy** that safeguards revenue, optimizes costs, and builds stronger, more valuable customer relationships.

**Key Capabilities:**

* **Data Preparation:** Cleans and preprocesses raw customer data for model readiness, handling missing values and feature transformations.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key customer demographics, service usage, and payment patterns to understand factors influencing churn.
* **Advanced Modeling:** Trains and evaluates multiple robust machine learning models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting**) to identify the best predictor of churn.
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Addresses skewed churn data using techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to ensure fair and accurate model performance.
* **Model Interpretability (SHAP):** Provides insights into why a customer is predicted to churn by showing the individual impact of different features on the prediction.
* **Churn Prediction Function:** Offers a reusable function to predict churn for new, unseen customer data, including churn probability and a risk category.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For comprehensive data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building, preprocessing (scaling, encoding), evaluation metrics (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC AUC), and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
* **Imblearn (imbalanced-learn)**: Specifically for SMOTE and ImbPipeline to handle dataset imbalance.
* **SHAP**: For powerful model interpretability (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
* **Pickle**: For saving and loading trained machine learning models.

**Getting Started (Running the Notebook):**

1. **Download Files:** Ensure you have the `Churn_Prediction.ipynb` notebook and its associated dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) in the same directory.

2. **Install Libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imblearn shap
```

3. **Run Jupyter:** Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the directory containing the files:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. **Execute Cells:** Run all cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. This will perform:

   * Data loading
   * Preprocessing
   * EDA
   * Model training and evaluation
   * Interpretability analysis

**Usage Example (Predicting Churn for a New Customer):**

```python
new_customer_data = {
    'gender': 'Male',
    'SeniorCitizen': 0,
    'Partner': 'Yes',
    'Dependents': 'No',
    'tenure': 12,
    'PhoneService': 'Yes',
    'MultipleLines': 'No',
    'InternetService': 'DSL',
    'OnlineSecurity': 'No',
    'OnlineBackup': 'No',
    'DeviceProtection': 'No',
    'TechSupport': 'No',
    'StreamingTV': 'No',
    'StreamingMovies': 'No',
    'Contract': 'Month-to-month',
    'PaperlessBilling': 'Yes',
    'PaymentMethod': 'Electronic check',
    'MonthlyCharges': 75.0,
    'TotalCharges': 900.0
}

churn_prediction_result = predict_churn(new_customer_data, tuned_model, model_metadata)

print("Customer Churn Prediction:")
print(churn_prediction_result)
```

This will output the churn probability, the binary churn prediction (True/False), and a risk category (Low, Medium, High).

**Future Enhancements:**

* **Real-time Prediction API:** Deploy the trained model as a web service for real-time churn prediction in CRM systems.
* **Automated Retentions Campaigns:** Integrate predictions with marketing platforms to trigger personalized retention campaigns.
* **Dashboarding:** Use Dash, Streamlit, or Power BI for interactive visualization of churn trends and prediction results.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Include engagement scores or aggregated usage statistics.
* **Deep Learning Models:** Experiment with neural networks for improved accuracy.
